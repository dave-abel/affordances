affordances
===========
A collection of files currently being used in our Affordances project.

Five main sets of files here:

	(1) burlap_files
		- MinecraftDomain.java := OOMDP model of Minecraft
		- MinecraftBehavior.java := runs VI on MinecraftDomain
		- MinecraftStateParser.java := just used to visualize states when run with BURLAP (for testing)
		- MinecraftVisualizer.java := 2D visualizer for Minecraft (for testing)

	(2) value_iter_bot
		- Mineflayer API side code for the Minecraft BOT
		- See list of possible commands for bot (executed via chat) in value_iter_bot/move.js
		- Desired use is to run a plan provided by generated by the Minecraft ValueIteration from BURLAP

	(3) minecraft_api 
		- Contains all the necessary files to setup a Minecraft server (in /craftbukkit) and client (minecraft-1.6.4.jar)

	(4) misc_code
		- Some miscellaneous algorithms we have implemented along the way
	
	(5) paper/presentation/proposal
		- Collection of supplementary material for the project

	(6) modeling
		- Miscellaneous attempts at modeling affordances and related structures

	(7) dependencies
		- Mallet: http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/
